A higher-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization using piecewise quadratic functions compatible with arbitrary polygonal meshes has been applied to the $S_N$ transport equation. These functions span $\{ 1,x,y,x^2,xy,y^2 \}$ and can be analytically integrated using a sub-cell triangulation.
