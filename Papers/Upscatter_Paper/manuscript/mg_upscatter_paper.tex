\section{Introduction} \label{sec::intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\tcr
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Brief description of outer-iteration scheme for multigroup problems (words only). Historically, this was a GS procedure.
\item Historical upscatter acceleration work:
\begin{itemize}
\item multifrequency-grey
\item Fission source acceleration
\item Averin and Voloschenko upscatter (nonlinear procedure)
\item Finally, TG and MTG. Can mention that Evans and Clarno specifically came up with TTG because MIP had not been developed and it wasn't known if a DSA scheme would be stable for unstructured multi-dimensional and multi-material problems.
\end{itemize}
\item Describe desire for parallelizable acceleration methodology motivated by massively-parallel computer architectures. Mention that our methods were motivated by the TG and MTG methods.
\item outline
\end{enumerate}
}

\section{Serial Gauss-Seidel Acceleration Methodologies} \label{sec::GS}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Two-Grid Acceleration}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\tcr{Give the outline of the TG method. This section would be a little longer since it would need to introduce the factorized error mode, the averaged diffusion equation, and the group-dependent update.}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Modified Two-Grid Acceleration}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\tcr
{
state differences with TG (this should be relatively short):
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1 sweep per group in GS procedure
\item spectral shape collapse eigenvalue equation
\item low-order residual
\end{enumerate}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Parallelizable Jacobi Acceleration Methodologies} \label{sec::Jac}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\tcr{Discuss desire to simultaneously solve transport sweeps. Propose the two Jacobi methods in the same mold as the GS methods (Modified means to not converge the inners).}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Jacobi Acceleration}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\tcr
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item do not want to converge inners with sweeps (would be silly to not communicate after each iteration)
\item want to estimate convergence of inners with a within-group DSA acceleration for each group
\item finish with spectrally-collapsed acceleration step
\end{enumerate}
}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Modified Jacobi Acceleration}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\tcr{
describe small difference with the Jacobi Acceleration which is the removal of the middle step (the within-group accelerations)
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Modified Interior Penalty Method} \label{sec::MIP}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\tcr{BRIEF overview of the MIP discretization with appropriate references. Turcksin and Ragusa is a short and straightforward presentation of MIP to base on.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Numerical Results} \label{sec::results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Fourier Analysis}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\tcr{Fourier and flat mode plots for the different methods.}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Homogeneous Graphite Configuration}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\tcr{I was thinking a simple table with iteration statistics for a homogenous cube problem.}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Heterogeneous Configurations}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\tcr{2D and 3D IM1 results}
