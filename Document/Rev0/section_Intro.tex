In this introductory chapter, we have presented a summary of work performed. We also gave our motivation for choosing this work as well as a brief discussion of previous work that has directly influenced this dissertation. We conclude this intoduction by briefly describing the remaining chapters of this dissertation.

In Chapter \ref{sec::Sn}, we present the DGFEM formulation for the multigroup, $S_N$ transport equation. We then describe the transport equation's discretization in energy, angle, and space. We have left the FEM spatial interpolation function as arbitrary at this point to be defined in detail in Chapter \ref{sec::BF}. For the spatial variable, we provide the theoretical convergence properties of the DGFEM form. We also detail the elementary assembly procedures to form the full set of spatial equations. We conclude by providing the methodology to be used to solve the full phase-space of the transport problem.

In Chapter \ref{sec::BF}, 

In Chapter \ref{sec::DSA}, 

We then finalize this dissertation work by drawing conclusions and discussing open topics of research stemming from this dissertation in Chapter \ref{sec::Conclusions}.
