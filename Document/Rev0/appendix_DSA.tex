\chapter{\uppercase {Extended MIP DSA Analysis}}
\label{sec::appendix_DSA}

In this appendix section, we will perform some additional analysis of the MIP diffusion form. We will assess the limits and nominal operational ranges of MIP in a lower dimensional space. Section \ref{sec::appendix_DSA_1D} will analyze the 1D MIP form while Section \ref{sec::appendix_DSA_2D} will analyze the 2D MIP form. For both 1D and 2D, Fourier Analysis along with some simple numerical studies are presented.

\section{MIP Analysis in 1D}
\label{sec::appendix_DSA_1D}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1D_transport_eq}
\mu \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \sigma_t (x) \psi(x,\mu) = \frac{\sigma_s (x)}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} \psi(x,\mu') \, d\mu' + \frac{Q(x)}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1D_transport_discangle}
\mu_m \frac{\partial \psi_m}{\partial x} + \sigma_t (x) \psi_m (x)= \frac{\sigma_s (x)}{2} \sum_{m'=1}^{M} \psi_m (x) + \frac{Q(x)}{2}
\end{equation}

The linear, cell-wise elementary matrices for the mass, stiffness, and gradient matrices for cell $j$ are

\begin{equation}
\label{MIP_1D_matrices}
\begin{aligned}
	M_j =& \frac{1}{6h_j}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
	2 & 1 \\
	1 & 2 
	\end{array} \right] ,\\
	K_j =& \frac{1}{h_j}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
	1 & -1 \\
	-1 & 1 
	\end{array} \right] ,\\
	G_j =& \frac{1}{2}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
	-1 & -1 \\
	 1 & 1 
	\end{array} \right] ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent respectively.


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1D_transport_discrete}
\mu_m \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \sigma_{t,j} \psi(x,\mu) = \frac{\sigma_s (x)}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} \psi(x,\mu') \, d\mu' + \frac{Q(x)}{2}
\end{equation}
