\chapter{\uppercase {The DGFEM Formulation of the Multigroup $S_N$ Equations}}
\label{sec::Sn}

The movement of bulk materials and particles through some medium can be described with the statistical behavior of a non-equilibrium system. Boltzmann first devised these probabilistic field equations to characterize fluid flow via driving temperature gradients \cite{encyc_physics}. His work was later extended to model general fluid flow, heat conduction, hamiltonian mechanics, quantum theory, general relativity, and radiation transport, among others. The Boltzmann Equation can be written in the general form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::gen_boltzmann}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \right)_{force} + \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \right)_{advec} + \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \right)_{coll}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $u(\vec{r},\vec{p},t)$ is the transport distribution function parameterized in terms of position, $\vec{r}=(x,y,z)$, momentum, $\vec{p}=(p_x,p_y,p_z)$, and time, $t$. In simplified terms, Eq. (\ref{eq::gen_boltzmann}) can be interpreted that the time rate of the change of the distribution function, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$, is equal to the sum of the change rates due to external forces, $\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \right)_{force} $, advection of the particles, $\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \right)_{advec}$, and particle-to-particle and particle-to-matter collisions, $\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \right)_{coll}$ \cite{mcgraw_physics}. 

For neutral particle transport, the following assumptions \cite{duderstadt1979transport} about the behavior of the radiation particles can be utilized:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Particles may be considered as points;
	\item Particles do not interact with other particles;
	\item Particles interact with material target atoms in a binary manner;
	\item Collisions between particles and material target atoms are instantaneous;
	\item Particles do not experience any external force fields ({\em e.g.} gravity).
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions lead to the first order form of the Boltzmann Transport Equation, which we simply call the transport equation for brevity. The remainder of the chapter is layed out as follows. Section \ref{sec::Sn_neut} provides the general form of the neutron transport equation with some variants. Section \ref{sec::Sn_MG} describes how we discretize the transport equation in energy with the multigroup methodology and Section \ref{sec::Sn_Angle} presents the angular discretization via collocation. Section \ref{sec::Sn_Spatial} will conclude our discretization procedures in the spatial domain. Section \ref{sec::Sn_Solution} will present the iterative procedures used to converge our solution space. We then present concluding remarks for the chapter in Section \ref{sec::Sn_Conclusions}.

%%%   Section - Neutron Transport Equation
\section{The Neutron Transport Equation}
\label{sec::Sn_neut}

The time-dependent neutron angular flux, $\Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega}, t)$, at spatial position $\vec{r}$, with energy $E$ moving in direction $\vec{\Omega}$ and at time $t$, is defined within an open, convex spatial domain $\mathcal{D}$, with boundary, $\partial \mathcal{D}$ by the general neutron transport equation:


\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_transport_eq_full}
\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} + \vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{\nabla} \Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t)+ \sigma_t (\vec{r}, E,t) \Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t) =Q_{ext} (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t) \\
	+ \frac{\chi (\vec{r}, E,t)}{4 \pi} \int dE' \nu \sigma_f (\vec{r}, E',t) \int d\Omega' \Psi (\vec{r}, E', \vec{\Omega}',t) \\ 
	+ \int dE' \int d\Omega' \sigma_s (E' \rightarrow E, \Omega' \rightarrow \Omega) \Psi (\vec{r}, E', \vec{\Omega}')
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent with the following, general boundary condition:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_transport_bc_full}
\begin{aligned}
	\Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t) = \Psi^{inc} (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t) + \int dE' \int d\Omega' \gamma (\vec{r}, E' \rightarrow E, \vec{\Omega}' \rightarrow \vec{\Omega},t) \Psi (\vec{r}, E', \vec{\Omega}',t) \\
	\text{for } \vec{r} \in \partial \mathcal{D}^{-} \left\{   \partial \mathcal{D}, \vec{\Omega}' \cdot \vec{n} < 0  \right\}
\end{aligned} .
\end{equation}

\noindent In Eqs. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_full}) and (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_bc_full}), the physical properties of the system are defined as the following: $\sigma_t (\vec{r}, E,t)$ is the total neutron cross section, $\chi (\vec{r}, E,t)$ is the neutron fission spectrum, $\sigma_f (\vec{r}, E',t)$ is the fission cross section, $\nu (\vec{r}, E',t)$ is the average number of neutroncs emitted per fission, $\sigma_s (E' \rightarrow E, \Omega' \rightarrow \Omega,t)$ is the scattering cross section, and $Q_{ext} (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t)$ is a distributed external source. 

We can simplify Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_full}) to:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op}
	\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} + {\bf L} \Psi =  {\bf F} \Psi  + {\bf S} \Psi + {\bf Q},
\end{equation}

\noindent by dropping the dependent variable parameters and using the following operators:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_transport_operators}
\begin{aligned}
	{\bf L} \Psi &= \vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{\nabla} \Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t)+ \sigma_t (\vec{r}, E,t) \Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t), \\
	{\bf F} \Psi &= \frac{\chi (\vec{r}, E,t)}{4 \pi} \int dE' \nu \sigma_f (\vec{r}, E',t) \int d\Omega' \Psi (\vec{r}, E', \vec{\Omega}',t), \\
	{\bf S} \Psi &= \int dE' \int d\Omega' \sigma_s (E' \rightarrow E, \Omega' \rightarrow \Omega, t) \Psi (\vec{r}, E', \vec{\Omega}', t),  \\
	{\bf Q}       & = Q_{ext} (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega},t) ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\bf L}$ is the loss operator which includes total reaction and streaming, ${\bf F}$ is the fission operator, and ${\bf S}$ is the scattering operator. If we wish to analyze a transport problem at steady-state conditions, we simply drop the temporal derivative to form

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_SS}
	 {\bf L} \Psi =  {\bf F} \Psi  + {\bf S} \Psi + {\bf Q},
\end{equation}

\noindent and note that the operators of Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_operators}) no longer depend on time, $t$.

There is a special subset of transport problems that is routinely analyzed to determine the neutron behavior of a fissile system called the {\em k-eigenvalue problem}. In Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_full}), $\nu (\vec{r}, E)$ acts as a multiplicative factor on the number of neutrons emitted per fission event. We replace this multiplicative factor in the following manner:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_nubar_k}
	\nu (\vec{r}, E) \rightarrow \frac{\tilde{\nu} (\vec{r}, E)}{k},
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have introduced the eigenvalue, $k$. By also dropping the external source term, the steady-state neutron transport equation in Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_SS}) can be rewritten into

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_keff}
	\left( {\bf L}  - {\bf S} \right) \tilde{\Psi} =  \frac{1}{k} {\bf F} \tilde{\Psi} ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $(k, \tilde{\Psi})$ forms an appropriate eigenvalue-eigenvector pair. Of most interest is the eigenpair corresponding to the eigenvalue of largest magnitude.

We can then gain knowledge of the behavior of the neutron population in the problem by taking the full phase-space integrals of the loss operator $\int  \int \int \, {\bf L} \tilde{\Psi} \, dE \, d\Omega \, d\vec{r}$, the fission operator $\int  \int \int \, {\bf F} \tilde{\Psi} \, dE \, d\Omega \, d\vec{r}$, and the scattering operator $\int  \int \int \, {\bf S} \tilde{\Psi} \, dE \, d\Omega \, d\vec{r}$. With the appropriate eigenvector solution, $\tilde{\Psi}$, the $k$ eigenvalue then has the meaning as the multiplicative value which balances Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_keff}) in an integral sense. This means that $k$ also has a physical meaning as well. A value $k<1$ is called subcritical and corresponds to a system whose neutron population decreases in time; a value $k=1$ is called critical and corresponds to a system whose neutron population remains constant in time; and a value $k>1$ is called supercritical and corresponds to a system whose neutron population increases in time \cite{ott1989}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%   Section - Energy Discretization
\section{Energy Discretization}
\label{sec::Sn_MG}

We begin our discretization procedures by focusing on the angular flux's energy variable. An ubiquitous energy discretization procedure in the transport community is the multigroup method \cite{duderstadt1976nuclear,lewis1984computational}. The multigroup method is defined by splitting the angular flux solution into $G$ number of distinct, contiguous, and non-overlapping energy intervals called groups. We begin by restricting the full energy domain, $[0, \infty)$, into a finite domain, $E \in [E_G, E_0]$. $E_0$ corresponds to some maximum energy value and $E_G$ corresponds to some minimum energy value (typically 0). We have done this by defining $G+1$ discrete energy values that are in a monotonically continuous reverse order: $E_G < E_{G-1} <  \ldots < E_1 < E_0$. 

From this distribution of energy values, we then say that a particular energy group, $g$, corresponds to the following energy interval:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_MG_energy_interval}
\Delta E_g \in [E_g, E_{g-1}].
\end{equation}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig::Sn_MG_energy_bands} provides a visual representation between the $G+1$ discrete energy values and the $G$ energy groups. While the order that we have prescribed may seem illogical (high-to-low), it has been historically applied this way because radiation transport problems are iteratively solved from high energy to low energy. If the group structure is well chosen, then the transport solution can be more efficiently and easily obtained with this high-to-low energy group structure.

\begin{figure}[bht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.00\textwidth]{figures/sec_Sn/MG_Energy_Bands.eps}
\caption{Interval structure of the multigroup methodology.}
\label{fig::Sn_MG_energy_bands}
\end{figure}

For the remainder of this energy discretization procedure, we will utilize the steady-state form of the transport equation in Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_SS}). The time-dependent and eigenvalue forms are analagous and would be derived identically. Taking the energy interval for group $g$ as defined in Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_MG_energy_interval}), the energy-integrated angular flux of group $g$ is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_MG_ang_flux_g}
\Psi_g (\vec{r}, \vec{\Omega}) = \int_{E_g}^{E_{g-1}} \, \Psi (\vec{r}, E, \vec{\Omega}) \, dE .
\end{equation}

\noindent We can then use the energy-integrated angular flux to form the following coupled, $(g=1,...,G)$, discrete equations (we have dropped the spatial parameter and some of the angular parameters for further clarity):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_MG_trans_eq}
\left(  \vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{\nabla} + \sigma_{t,g}  \right) \Psi_g =  \sum_{g'=1}^{G} \left[ \frac{\chi_g}{4 \pi} \nu \sigma_{f,g'} \int_{4 \pi} \Psi_{g'} (\vec{\Omega}') \, d\Omega' + \int_{4 \pi} \sigma_{s}^{g' \rightarrow g} (\vec{\Omega}' , \vec{\Omega} ) \Psi_{g'} (\vec{\Omega}')  \, d\Omega'  \right] + Q_g
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_MG_exact_condensed_terms}
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{t,g} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}) & \equiv \frac{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \sigma_{t} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega},E) \Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}, E) \, dE}{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \int_{4 \pi} \Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}, E) \, dE}\\
\nu\sigma_{f,g} (\vec{r}) & \equiv \frac{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \nu\sigma_{f} (\vec{r},E)  \int_{4 \pi} \Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}, E) \, dE d\Omega}{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \int_{4 \pi} \Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}, E) \, dE d\Omega} \\
\chi_g & \equiv \int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \chi  (\vec{r},E) \, dE \\
\sigma_{s}^{g' \rightarrow g} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}' , \vec{\Omega} ) & \equiv \frac{\int_{E_{g'}}^{E_{g'-1}} \left[ \int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \sigma_s (\vec{r},E' \rightarrow E,\vec{\Omega}' , \vec{\Omega} ) \, dE \right] \Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}', E') \, dE' }{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}}  \Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}, E) \, dE} \\
Q_g (\vec{r}, \vec{\Omega}) & \equiv \int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} Q (\vec{r}, \vec{\Omega}, E) \, dE
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The above equations are mathematically exact to those presented in Eqs. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_full} - \ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_SS}) and we have made no approximations at this time. However, this requires full knowledge of the energy distribution of the angular flux solution at all positions in our problem domain since we weight the multigroup cross sections with this solution. This is obviously impossible since the energy distibution is part of the solution space we are trying to solve for. Instead, we now define the process to make the multigroup discretization an effective approximation method.

We first define an approximate angular flux distribution for a region $s$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_MG_flux_approx}
\Psi (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}, E) =  \hat{\Psi} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}) f_{s} (E) ,
\end{equation}

\noindent which is a factorization of the angular flux solution into a region-dependent energy function, $f_s (E)$, and a spatially/angularly dependent function, $\hat{\Psi} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega})$. With this approximation, we can redefine the energy-collapsed cross sections of Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_MG_exact_condensed_terms}):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::MG_approx_condensed_terms}
\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{t,g} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}) & \equiv \frac{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \sigma_{t} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega},E) f_{s} (E) \, dE}{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} f_{s} (E) \, dE} ,\\
\nu\sigma_{f,g} (\vec{r}) & \equiv \frac{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \nu\sigma_{f} (\vec{r},E)  f_{s} (E) \, dE }{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} f_{s} (E) \, dE}, \\
\sigma_{s}^{g' \rightarrow g} (\vec{r},\vec{\Omega}' , \vec{\Omega} ) & \equiv \frac{\int_{E_{g'}}^{E_{g'-1}} \left[ \int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}} \sigma_s (\vec{r},E' \rightarrow E,\vec{\Omega}' , \vec{\Omega} ) \, dE \right] f_{s} (E')\, dE' }{\int_{E_{g}}^{E_{g-1}}  f_{s} (E) \, dE} .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent It is noted that we do not need to redefine the fission spectrum or the distributed external sources since they are not weighted with the angular flux solution. With this energy factorization, we would expect, in general, that the approximation error will tend to zero as the number of discrete energy groups increases (thereby making the energy bins thinner). This is especially true if the group structure is chosen with many more bins in energy regions with large variations in the energy solution. For certain problems, the region-dependent energy function is well understood ({\em i.e.} almost exactly known). This means, that for these problems, we can achieve reasonable solution accuracy with only a few groups where the energy bins of the multigroup discretization are well chosen. A good example of these kinds of problems are thermal-spectrum nuclear reactors which have historically achieved reasonable solutions with as few as 4-10 energy groups.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%   Section - Angle Discretization
\section{Angular Discretization}
\label{sec::Sn_Angle}

Now that we have provided the discretization of the energy variable, we next focus on the discretization of the transport problem in angle. We will do this in two stages: 1) expand the angular flux in the scattering source and the distributed external source in spherical harmonics and 2) collocate the angular flux at the interpolation points of the trial space. We will perform these discretization procedures by taking the stready-state equation presented in Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_transport_eq_op_SS}), dropping the fission term and spatial parameterization, and using only 1 energy group:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_Angle_simple_trans_eq}
\vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{\nabla} \Psi (\vec{\Omega}) + \sigma_t \Psi (\vec{\Omega}) = \int_{4 \pi}  d\Omega' \, \sigma_s ( \vec{\Omega}' \cdot \vec{\Omega}) \Psi (\vec{\Omega}') + Q  (\vec{\Omega}) .
\end{equation}

We first expand the angular flux, scattering cross section and external source in spherical harmonics:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_Angle_moments}
\begin{aligned}
	\Phi_{p,n} &\equiv \int_{4 \pi} d\Omega \, \Psi(\vec{\Omega}) \, Y_{p,n} (\vec{\Omega}) \\
	\sigma_{s,p} &\equiv  \int_{-1}^{1} \, d \mu \, \sigma_s ( \mu) P_p (\mu)  \\
	Q_{p,n} &\equiv 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have used the following relationships:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_Angle_other_terms}
\begin{aligned}
	\mu &\equiv \vec{\Omega}' \cdot \vec{\Omega} \\
	\sigma_s ( \vec{\Omega}' \cdot \vec{\Omega}) &\equiv  \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sigma_s ( \mu ) \\
	P_p ( \vec{\Omega}' \cdot \vec{\Omega}) &\equiv  \frac{1}{2 \pi} P_p (\mu)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We conclude our discussion of angular discretizations by presenting two common angular quadrature sets that will be employed in this dissertation work. Section \ref{sec::Sn_Angle_LS} presents the Level Symmetric (LS) quadrature set and Section \ref{sec::Sn_Angle_PGLC} presents the Product Gauss-Legendre-Chebyshev (PGLC) quadrature set.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%   SubSection - PGLC
\subsection{Product Gauss-Legendre-Chebyshev Quadrature Set}
\label{sec::Sn_Angle_PGLC}

The second angular quadrature set we will present is a Product Gauss-Legendre-Chebyshev (PGLC) set. It is formed by the product-wise multiplication of a Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature in the azimuthal direction and a Gauss-Legendre quadrature in the polar direction. It has the following key differences from the Level Symmetric set:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Does not have $90^o$ rotational invariance within the primary octant; still maintains octant-to-octant symmetry however;
	\item Has more control over the placement of the anglular directions within the primary octant;
	\item Quadrature weights are aligned with the polar level;
	\item Has strictly positive weights for all polar and azimuthal combinations.
\end{itemize}

From the listed differences, we can already discern some clear advantages and disadvantages from a fully-symmetric quadrature set like LS. If a high number of angles are required for a problem, then negative weights do not arise. This is beneficial for transport problems with significant discontinuities. Also, the quadrature directions can be preferentially distributed in the primary octant if required for a particular problem. For example, if the transport solution is smoothly varying in the polar direction and not in the azimuthal direction, then we can specify a larger number of quadrature points in the azimuthal direction, with much fewer points in the polar direction. However, this also highlights the fact that the quadrature weights are aligned with the polar level, which can lead to less accurate moment integrations for certain transport problems. 

For this dissertation, we will use the following notation to define the product nature of the PGLC quadrature points: $S_{a}^{p}$. Here, $a$ and $p$ correspond to the number of azimuthal and polar directions in the primary octant, respectively. We demonstrate this definition in Figure \ref{fig::Sn_Angle_PGLC_Quads} with several combinations of azimuthal and polar directions. Again, the size of the direction marker corresponds to the relative weight of quadrature point. One can clearly see that the weights vary on the polar levels and all azimuthal weights on a given polar level are constant.

\label{sec::Sn_Spatial}

Using the energy and angular discretizations presented in Sections \ref{sec::Sn_MG} and \ref{sec::Sn_Angle}, respectively, we write the standard, steady-state, multigroup $S_N$ transport equation for one angular direction, $m$, and one energy group, $g$:

\begin{equation}

\end{aligned} , 
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have dropped the spatial parameter for clariy and is beholden to the following general, discretized boundary condition:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_mg_sn_trans_eq_bc}
\Psi_{m,g} (\vec{r}) = \Psi^{inc}_{m,g} (\vec{r}) + \sum_{g'=1}^{G} \sum_{\vec{\Omega}_{m'} \cdot \vec{n} > 0} \gamma_{g' \rightarrow g}^{m' \rightarrow m} (\vec{r})  \Psi_{m',g'} (\vec{r})  .
\end{equation}

\noindent These $(M \text{x} G)$ number of discrete, tightly-coupled equations are currently defined as continuous in space.

For this dissertation work, we will consider only one type of boundary conditions: Dirichlet-type boundaries (also called {\em first-type boundary condition} in some physics and mathematical communities). In particular we will only utilize incoming-incident and reflecting boundary conditions which correspond to $\vec{r} \in \partial \mathcal{D}^d$ and $\vec{r} \in \partial \mathcal{D}^r$, respectively. The full domain boundary is then the union: $\partial \mathcal{D} = \partial \mathcal{D}^d \cup \partial \mathcal{D}^r$. This leads to the boundary condition being succinctly written for one angular direction, $m$, and one energy group, $g$ as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_simple_BC}
\Psi_{m,g} (\vec{r}) = \begin{cases}
	\Psi^{inc}_{m,g} (\vec{r}) , & \vec{r} \in \partial \mathcal{D}^d \\
	\Psi_{m',g} (\vec{r}) , & \vec{r} \in \partial \mathcal{D}^r
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the reflecting angle is $\vec{\Omega}_{m'} = \vec{\Omega}_{m} - 2 \left(  \vec{\Omega}_{m} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \vec{n}$ and $\vec{n}$ is oriented outward from the domain. To properly utilize the reflecting boundary condition that we have proposed, the angular quadrature set defined in Section \ref{sec::Sn_Angle} needs the following properties.

\begin{enumerate}
 	\item The reflected directions, $\vec{\Omega}_{m'}$, are also in the quadrature set for all $\vec{r} \in \partial \mathcal{D}^r$.
	\item The weights of the incident, $w_m$, and reflected, $w_{m'}$, angles must be equal.
\end{enumerate} 

\noindent For problems where the reflecting boundaries align with the $x,y,z$ axes, this will not be an issue with standard quadrature sets ({\em e.g.} level-symmetric or Gauss-Legendre-Chebyshev). However, if the reflecting boundaries do not align in this manner, then additional care must be employed in calculating appropriate angular quadrature sets.

For the spatial discretization of the problem domain, we simplify Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_mg_sn_trans_eq}) into a single energy group and drop the fission term (it can be lumped into the 0th order external source term and will act similarly to the total interaction term)

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_trans_eq_simple_no_energy_groups}
\vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{\nabla} \Psi_{m}  + \sigma_{t}   \Psi_{m}=  \sum_{p=0}^{N_P} \frac{2p + 1}{4 \pi}    \sum_{n=-p}^{p}  Y_{p,n} (  \vec{\Omega}_m ) \left[ \sigma_{s,p}  \Phi_{p,n,}  + Q_{p,n} \right]
\end{equation}

\noindent to form $M$ ($m=1,...,M$) angularly discrete equations. We then lay down an unstructured mesh $\mathcal{T}_h \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, over the spatial domain, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem ($d=1,2,3$). This mesh consists of non-overlapping spatial elements to form a complete union over the entire spatial domain: $\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} K$. To form the DGFEM set of equations \cite{ern2013theory,wareing2001discontinuous}, we consider a spatial cell $K \in \mathbb{R}^d$ which has $N_V^K$ vertices and $N_f^K$ faces. Each face of cell $K$ resides in dimension $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ and is formed by a connection of a subset of vertices. For a 1D problem, each face is a single point. For a 2D problem, each face is a line segment connecting two distinct points. For a 3D problem, each face is a $\mathbb{R}^2$ closed polygon (not necessarily coplanar) which may or not be convex. An example of this interconnection between elements is given for a $\mathbb{R}^2$ problem in Figure \ref{fig::Sn_two_ref_cells} between our cell of interest, $K$, and another cell, $K'$, separated by the face $f$. We have chosen the normal direction of the face to have orientation from cell $K$ to cell $K'$ while we form the DGFEM equations for cell $K$. This means that if we were instead analyzing cell $K'$, then the face $f$ normal, $\vec{n}' $, would be opposite ({\em i.e.} $\vec{n}' = -\vec{n}$).

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/sec_Sn/two_cells_Rev1.eps}

\label{fig::Sn_two_ref_cells}
\end{figure}

Next, we left-multiply Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_trans_eq_simple_no_energy_groups}) by an appropriate test function $b_m$, integrate over cell $K$, and apply Gauss' Divergence Theorem to the streaming term to obtain the Galerkin weighted-residual for cell $K$ for an angular direction $\vec{\Omega}_m$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_DGFEM_trans_eq_cellK}
\begin{aligned}
- \left( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot  \vec{\nabla} b_m, \Psi_{m} \right)_{K} + \sum_{f=1}^{N_f^K} \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, \tilde{\Psi}_m  \Big>_{f}  + \Big(  \sigma_{t} b_m ,   \Psi_{m} \Big)_{K} \\
= \sum_{p=0}^{N_P} \sum_{n=-p}^{p} \frac{2p + 1}{4 \pi}  Y_{p,n} (  \vec{\Omega}_m ) \left[ \Big( \sigma_{s,p} \, b_m,  \Phi_{p,n,} \Big)_{K}  + \left(  b_m ,   Q_{p,n} \right)_{K} \right]
\end{aligned} .
\end{equation}

\noindent The cell boundary fluxes, $\tilde{\Psi}_m$, will depend on the cell boundary type and will be defined shortly. The cell boundary $\partial \mathcal{D}_K = \bigcup_{ f \in N_f^K} f$ is the closed set of the $N_f^K$ faces of the geometric cell. The inner products:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_spatial_inner_products_cell}
 \Big( f, g \Big)_K \equiv \int_K f \, g \, d r
\end{equation} 

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_spatial_inner_products_face}
 \Big< f, g \Big>_f \equiv \int_f f \, g \, d s
\end{equation}

\noindent correspond to integrations over the cell and faces, respectively, where $dr \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is within the cell and $ds \in \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ is along the cell boundary. We note that we will use this notation of the inner product for the remainder of the dissertation unless otherwise stated. We then separate the summation of the cell $K$ boundary integration terms into two different types: outflow boundaries ($\partial K^+ = \{  \vec{r} \in \partial K: \vec{n} (\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{\Omega}_m > 0 \}$) and inflow boundaries ($\partial K^- = \{  \vec{r} \in \partial K: \vec{n} (\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{\Omega}_m < 0 \}$). The inflow boundaries can further be separated into inflow from another cell: $\partial K^- \backslash \partial \mathcal{D} $; inflow from incident flux on the domain boundary: $\partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^d $; and reflecting domain boundaries: $\partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^r $. At this point, we note that the derivation can comprise an additional step by using Gauss' Divergence Theorem again on the streaming term. This is sometimes performed for radiation transport work but we will not do so here. Therefore, with the cell boundary terminology as proposed, Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_DGFEM_trans_eq_cellK}) can be written into the following form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_DGFEM_trans_eq_cellK_diff_faces}
\begin{aligned}
- \left( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot  \vec{\nabla} b_m, \Psi_{m} \right)_{K}   + \Big(  \sigma_{t} b_m ,   \Psi_{m} \Big)_{K}  \\
+  \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, \tilde{\Psi}_m  \Big>_{\partial K^+}  + \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, \tilde{\Psi}_m  \Big>_{\partial K^- \backslash \partial \mathcal{D}} \\
  + \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, \tilde{\Psi}_m  \Big>_{\partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^d}  + \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, \tilde{\Psi}_m  \Big>_{\partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^r}  \\
= \sum_{p=0}^{N_P} \sum_{n=-p}^{p} \frac{2p + 1}{4 \pi}  Y_{p,n} (  \vec{\Omega}_m ) \left[ \Big( \sigma_{s,p} \, b_m,  \Phi_{p,n,} \Big)_{K}  + \left(  b_m ,   Q_{p,n} \right)_{K} \right]
\end{aligned} .
\end{equation}

We can now deal with the boundary fluxes, $\tilde{\Psi}_m$, by enforcing the ubiquitously-used {\em upwind scheme}. In simple nomenclature, the upwind scheme corresponds to using the angular flux values within the cell for outflow boundaries and angular flux values outside the cell for inflow boundaries. Mathematically, the upwind scheme can succinctly be written as the following for all boundary types,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_upwind_cases}
\tilde{\Psi}_m (\vec{r}) = \begin{cases}
\Psi_m^{-} , & \partial K^+ \\
\Psi_m^{+}, & \partial K^- \backslash \partial \mathcal{D} \\
\Psi_m^{inc}, & \partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^d \\
\Psi_{m'}^{-}, & \partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^r
\end{cases} ,
\end{equation}

\noindent when the following trace is applied to the angular fluxes :

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_ang_flux_trace}
\Psi_m^{\pm} (\vec{r}) \equiv \lim_{s \rightarrow 0^{\pm}} \Psi_m \Big( \vec{r} + s (\vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n}) \vec{\Omega}_m \Big) .
\end{equation}

\noindent This trace has the notation, with $\vec{n}$ pointing outwards from cell $K$, of $\Psi_m^-$ corresponding to fluxes within the cell and $\Psi_m^+$ corresponding to fluxes out of the cell. Now, using the upwind scheme as previously defined, we can write our complete set of DGFEM equations for cell $K$ as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_DGFEM_trans_eq_cellK_complete}
\begin{aligned}
-  \Big( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot  & \vec{\nabla} b_m, \Psi_{m} \Big)_{K}   + \Big(  \sigma_{t} b_m ,   \Psi_{m} \Big)_{K} +  \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, {\Psi}_m^{-}  \Big>_{\partial K^+}  \\
  + & \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, {\Psi}_m^{+}  \Big>_{\partial K^- \backslash \partial \mathcal{D}}  + \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, {\Psi}^{-}_{m'}  \Big>_{\partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^r}  \\
= & \sum_{p=0}^{N_P} \sum_{n=-p}^{p} \frac{2p + 1}{4 \pi}  Y_{p,n} (  \vec{\Omega}_m ) \left[ \Big( \sigma_{s,p} \, b_m,  \Phi_{p,n,} \Big)_{K}  + \left(  b_m ,   Q_{p,n} \right)_{K} \right] \\
+ & \Big< ( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{n} ) \, b_m, {\Psi}_m^{inc}  \Big>_{\partial K^- \cap \partial \mathcal{D}^d}
\end{aligned} .
\end{equation} 

\noindent We note that fluxes without the trace superscript are all within the cell. By completely defining our mathematical formulation for an arbitrary spatial cell, it is easy to see that the full set of equations to define our discretized solution space for a single angle and energy group comprises of a simple double integration loop. The full set of equations can be formed by looping over all spatial cells, $\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{K \in \mathcal{T}_h} K$, while further looping over all faces within each cell, $\partial \mathcal{D}_K = \bigcup_{ f \in N_f^K} f$. Section \ref{sec::Sn_Solution} will further detail how all the DGFEM equations are formed along with efficient solution methods. We conclude this section by defining the elementary matrix terms for a given cell as follows.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%   SubSection - Mass
\subsection{Elementary Mass Matrices}
\label{sec::Sn_Spatial_Mass}

In the spatially discretized equations presented in Section \ref{sec::Sn_Spatial}, there are several reaction terms that appear with the form: $\Big( \sigma  b_m , \Psi_m  \Big)_K$ for a given angular direction, $m$, and for a spatial cell, $K$. In FEM analysis these reaction terms are ubiquitously referred to as the mass matrix terms \cite{zeinkiewicz2005finite,akin1982application}. For cell $K$, we define the elementary mass matrix, ${\bf M}$ as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_mass_matrix_analytical}
{\bf M}_K =    \int_K {\bf b}_K \, {\bf b}_K^T \, d {\vec{r}} ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\bf b}_K$ corresponds to the set of $N_K$ basis functions that have non-zero measure in cell $K$. Depending on the FEM basis functions utilized, the integrals in Eq. (\ref{eq::Sn_mass_matrix_analytical}) can be directly integrated analytically. However, if in general, the basis functions cannot be analytically integrated on an arbitrary set of cell shapes, then a numerical integration scheme becomes necessary. If we define a quadrature set, $\left\{  \vec{x}_q , w_q^{K}  \right\}_{q=1}^{N_q}$, for cell $K$, consisting of $N_q$ points, $\vec{x}_q$, and weights, $w_q^K$, then we can numerically calculate the mass matrix by the following

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_mass_matrix_numerical}
{\bf M}_K =    \sum_{q = 1}^{N_q} w_{q}^K {\bf b}_K (\vec{x}_q) \, {\bf b}_K^T (\vec{x}_q)  .
\end{equation}

\noindent In this case, it is necessary that the sum of the weights of this quadrature set exactly equal the geometric measure of cell $K$. This means that $\sum_{q = 1}^{N_q} w_{q}^K$ is equal to the cell width in 1 dimension, the cell area in 2 dimensions, and the cell volume in 3 dimensions.

Since ${\bf b}_K$ consists of a column vector for the basis functions and ${\bf b}_K^{T}$ consists of a row vector, then their multiplication will obviously yield a full $(N_K \, \text{x} \, N_K)$ matrix. This matrix is written for completeness of this discussion on the mass matrix:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_mass_matrix_array}
{\bf M}_K =   \left[
\begin{array} {ccccc}
	\int_K b_1 \, b_1  & \ldots & \int_K b_1 \, b_j  & \ldots & \int_K b_1 \, b_{N_K} \\
	\vdots  &  & \vdots  &  & \vdots \\
	\int_K b_i \, b_1  & \ldots & \int_K b_i \, b_j  & \ldots & \int_K b_i \, b_{N_K} \\
	\vdots  &  & \vdots  &  & \vdots \\
	\int_K b_{N_K} \, b_1  & \ldots & \int_K b_{N_K} \, b_j  & \ldots & \int_K b_{N_K} \, b_{N_K} \\
\end{array}
\right] ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where an individual matrix entry is of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_mass_matrix_entry}
M_{i,j}^K =  \int_K b_i \, b_j .
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%   SubSection - Streaming
\subsection{Elementary Streaming Matrices}
\label{sec::Sn_Spatial_Streaming}

Next, we will consider the streaming term that has the form: $ \Big( \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot \vec{\nabla}  b_m , \Psi_m  \Big)_K$ for a given angular direction, $m$, and for a spatial cell, $K$. $\vec{\nabla} $ is the gradient operator in physical space. It has the form of $\vec{\nabla} = \left[ \frac{d}{dx} \right]$ in 1 dimension, the form of $\vec{\nabla} = \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right]$ in 2 dimensions, and the form of $\vec{\nabla} = \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial}{\partial y} , \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right]$ in 3 dimensions. Since for every cell, the streaming term is applied for all $M$ angles in the angular discretization, we define the analytical elementary streaming matrix:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_streaming_matrix_analytical}
\vec{{\bf G}}_K =    \int_K \vec{\nabla} {\bf b}_K \, {\bf b}_K^T \, d {\vec{r}} ,
\end{equation}

\noindent which has dimensionality $(N_K \text{x} N_K \text{x} d)$. We choose to store the elementary streaming matrix in this form and not store $M$ separate $(N_K \text{x} N_K)$ local matrices corresponding to the application of the dot product ($ \vec{\Omega}_m  \cdot \int_K  \vec{\nabla} {\bf b}_K \, {\bf b}_K^T \, d {\vec{r}}$). Instead we simply evaluate the dot product with the appropriate angular direction whenever necessary. This has great benefit when trying to run large transport problems when memory becomes a premium and processor operations are not our limiting bottleneck. 

Just like the elementary mass matrix, we can use the same spatial quadrature set, $\left\{  \vec{x}_q , w_q^{K}  \right\}_{q=1}^{N_q}$, for cell $K$ to numerically calculate the streaming matrix:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_streaming_matrix_numerical}
\vec{{\bf G}}_K =    \sum_{q = 1}^{N_q} w_{q}^K \vec{\nabla} {\bf b}_K (\vec{x}_q) \, {\bf b}_K^T (\vec{x}_q) .
\end{equation}

\noindent In this case, this local cell-wise streaming matrix has the full matrix form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_streaming_matrix_array}
\vec{{\bf G}}_K =   \left[
\begin{array} {ccccc}
	\int_K \vec{\nabla}b_1 \, b_1  & \ldots & \int_K \vec{\nabla}b_1 \, b_j  & \ldots & \int_K \vec{\nabla}b_1 \, b_{N_K} \\
	\vdots  &  & \vdots  &  & \vdots \\
	\int_K \vec{\nabla} b_i \, b_1  & \ldots & \int_K \vec{\nabla}b_i \, b_j  & \ldots & \int_K \vec{\nabla}b_i \, b_{N_K} \\
	\vdots  &  & \vdots  &  & \vdots \\
	\int_K \vec{\nabla} b_{N_K} \, b_1  & \ldots & \int_K \vec{\nabla} b_{N_K} \, b_j  & \ldots & \int_K \vec{\nabla} b_{N_K} \, b_{N_K} \\
\end{array}
\right] ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where an individual matrix entry is of the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::Sn_streaming_matrix_entry}
\vec{G}_{i,j}^K =  \int_K \vec{\nabla}b_i \, b_j .
\end{equation}

Finally, the last terms to consider of the discretized transport equation are those found on the faces of the cell boundary: $  \vec{\Omega}_m \cdot  \Big<  \vec{n} \, b_m, \Psi_m  \Big>_{\partial K}$. These terms are analagous to the cell mass matrix but are computed on the cell boundary with dimensionality $(d-1)$.

Section \ref{sec::Sn_Solution_Iterative} will discuss the different iterative procedures that can be employed to efficiently converge the angular and energy portions of the solution space and Section \ref{sec::Sn_Solution_Sweeping} will then discuss how we can efficiently solve the spatial portion of the solution for any given iteration or applicable mesh. We conclude by describing an efficient means to
