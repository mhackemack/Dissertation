\section{Limits of the Linear Polygonal Basis Functions}
\label{sec::appendix_BF_Limits}

As it was stated in Section \ref{sec::BF_2DLinear}, the Wachspress, mean value, and maximum entropy coordinates are all undefined on the boundary of the polygonal element.

\subsection{Limits of the Mean Value Coordinates}
\label{sec::appendix_BF_Limits_MV}

\begin{equation}
