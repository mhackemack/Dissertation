\label{sec::appendix_BF_Limits}

As it was stated in Section \ref{sec::BF_2DLinear}, the Wachspress, mean value, and maximum entropy coordinates are all undefined on the boundary of the polygonal element.

\label{sec::appendix_BF_Limits_Wachspress}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::App_BF_WachBF}
\lambda_i^{W} (\vec{x}) = \frac{w_i^W  (\vec{x}) }{\sum_j w_j^W  (\vec{x}) }
\end{equation}

\noindent where the weight function for vertex $i$, $w_i$, has the following definition:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::BF_wach_weights}
w_i (\vec{x})  = \frac{A(\vec{x}_{i-1}, \vec{x}_{i}, \vec{x}_{i+1})}{A(\vec{x}, \vec{x}_{i-1}, \vec{x}_{i}) \, A(\vec{x}, \vec{x}_{i}, \vec{x}_{i+1})}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Limits of the Mean Value Coordinates}
\label{sec::appendix_BF_Limits_MV}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::App_BF_MVBF}
\lambda_i^{MV} (\vec{x}) = \frac{w_i^{MV}  (\vec{x}) }{\sum_j w_j^{MV}  (\vec{x}) }
\end{equation}

\noindent where the weight function for vertex $i$, $w_i$, has the following definition:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::BF_MV_weights}
w_i (\vec{x})  = \frac{\tan(\alpha_{i-1} / 2) + \tan(\alpha_i / 2)}{|\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}|}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Limits of the Maximum Entropy Coordinates}
\label{sec::appendix_BF_Limits_ME}


\begin{equation}
\label{eq::App_BF_MEBF}
\lambda_i^{ME} (\vec{x}) = \frac{w_i^{ME}  (\vec{x}) }{\sum_j w_j^{ME}  (\vec{x}) }
\end{equation}

\noindent where the weight function for vertex $i$, $w_i$, has the following definition:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq::BF_ME_weights}
w_i (\vec{x})  = m_i(\vec{x}) \exp(-  \kappa \cdot (\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}))
\end{equation}

%%%   Section - Analytical 2D PWL Integration
\section{Analytical Integration of the 2D PWL Basis Functions}
\label{sec::appendix_BF_PWL2}

In Section \ref{sec::BF_2DLinear_PWL}, we provided the functional form for the Piecewise Linear (PWL) coordinates. We noted that of the linearly-complete 2D polygonal coordinates, PWL is the only one that can perform analytical integrations of the elementary matrices. We now describe the procedures to perform these analytical integrations of the elementary matrices.


\begin{equation}
\label{eq::2D_tri_ref_BF}
\begin{aligned}
	b_1(r,s) & = 1-r-s \\
	b_2(r,s) & = r \\
	b_3(r,s) & = s 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}

\begin{aligned}
	b_1(r,s,t) & = 1-r-s-t \\
	b_2(r,s,t) & = r \\

	b_4(r,s,t) & = t
